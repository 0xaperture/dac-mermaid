# Documentation as Code
Documentation as code brings documentation into the same workflows as software—version control, peer reviews, automation, and co-location with the code—ensuring accuracy, consistency, and easier collaboration. It keeps docs current, traceable, and governed by the same CI/CD processes that maintain code quality.

Mermaid is a strong option for this model because diagrams are defined as text, making them version-friendly, quick to update, and easy to render in Markdown-based docs. While its visuals are simpler than dedicated design tools, Mermaid excels for technical diagrams that evolve frequently, making documentation more maintainable and aligned with real system changes.

Below are a collection of examples I created for reference:
